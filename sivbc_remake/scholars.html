            <h2>Our Scholarship Fund Mission</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">At Sudden Impact, our mission is simple: "Provide the best training for junior volleyball players in the Puget Sound Region". But it's about more than just volleyball. We strive to help our athletes learn valuable skills and values like leadership, discipline, the value of hard work and the importance of being a great teammate that will help them succeed in volleyball and more importantly in life.
            <br>
             As part of that mission, we offer a limited number of needs-based scholarships each season to economically disadvantaged families to help them afford the rising cost of club volleyball with the goal of enabling as broad a set of young women to participate in our teams as possible.</p>

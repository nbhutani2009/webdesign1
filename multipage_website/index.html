    <p>Indoor volleyball is the most common version of volleyball and the kind that people think of when they hear the word. Indoor volleyball is played in a gym, with a court that is 30 feet long, with six players on the court at one time. 
        Pros: More people on the court, feet free to move without anything holding them back, not affected by weather or sunlight, AC indoors, softer

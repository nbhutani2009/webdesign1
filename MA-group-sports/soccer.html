   <h2>Interview with Soccer Players!!</h2>
   <h3> We have met with a couple of Soccer players at our school and this is what they had to say about tryouts:   </h3>
    <p>How do tryouts work?</p>
    <ul style="font-size: smaller; color: rgb(49, 49, 106);">
        <b><li>How does the tryout start and end?</li></b>
    <li>The practice starts with a basic athletic warm-up, and you start with simple moves like shooting goals, 1 on 1s, etc.</li>
    <li>Then you move on to scrimmiging, and you play in your posistions and scrimmage in seperate positions</li>
    <li> During the tryout, they pull several kids to offer them a spot, and for the rest of the tryout you continue scrimminging</li>
    <b><li>What should you do to prep for tryouts?</li></b>
    <li>First you should start by keeping consistency, and practicing dribbling, kicking and other drills in your free time will help you prep well. </li>
    <li>Its important to practice throwing and catching, also known as your fundamentals of ultimate</li>
    <li>Practice also defensive drills and offensive drills depending on the position</li>
    <li>Finding a partner would also be great! You can practice several drills together, and even play 1 on 1s for real game experience. </li>
    
    <b><li>Note: Even if you play a specific posistion, make sure you're getting practice around all skills!</li</b>
    </ul>
